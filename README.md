# Simple Notes (PWA)

**Simple Notes** is a minimalist note-taking app built with **React + Vite** and enhanced with **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support. It allows users to add, complete, and delete notes — even while offline. Once installed, it feels and functions like a native mobile or desktop app.
